# **Healthcare Data Analysis Report**

## **Introduction**

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of healthcare data using Power BI, a powerful business intelligence and data visualization tool. The dashboard was developed to gain actionable insights into patient demographics, visit trends, department referrals, and satisfaction scores.

The purpose of this analysis is to support healthcare providers and administrators in identifying patterns, improving patient experience, optimizing resource allocation, and making informed decisions. The visualizations provide a clear, interactive view of key performance indicators (KPIs), making it easier to detect areas for improvement and opportunities for better patient care.

## **Insights and Recommendations**

### **Insights**

Patient flow is higher in Q2â€“Q3, especially in August.

Monday shows peak visits; could indicate backlog from weekends.

A significant number of patients (5.4K) are not referred by departmentsâ€”opportunity for improving coordination and triage.

Older patients (60+) have lower satisfaction; this requires deeper service quality evaluation.

Minor but consistent satisfaction score differences across gender and race categories.

### **Recommendations**

Improve services for senior patients to increase satisfaction scores.

Balance staff allocation for Mondays and peak quarters/months.

Evaluate service quality and follow-up procedures for patients without department referrals.

Enhance PM session service quality, as patient satisfaction does not reflect volume consistency.

Explore the reasons behind lower scores in specific racial groups and adjust culturally sensitive care practices.
